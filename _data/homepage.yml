  title: "About the Summit"
  first_paragraph: "<p>One of the biggest changes of our time, is the shift to online education.</p><p>Today, there is a growing number of individual “teacher entrepreneurs” organizing what they know on any topic you can imagine into making thousands or in some case over a hundred thousand dollars in income every month.</p>"
  second_paragraph: "<p>They will be joined by Ankur Nagpal and Conrad Wadowski, founders of the online course hosting platform <a href='http://usefedora.com/?src=mdi-top' target='_blank'>Fedora</a> that has helped over 1,000 instructors sell online courses. Having seen 4k+ courses on their platform, they break down what makes a best-selling course stand out from the noise.</p><p>You may have a variety of goals before coming into this course – to get background on creating an online course, to create your first short course to promote your company, grow your thought leadership while making income on the side, or to learn the best practices to become a 'teacher entrepreneur.'</p><p>This course will take from scratch all the way to publishing and distributing your course, namely:</p><strong><p>Part 1: Develop your course</strong><br/>How you should pick your topic and test market demand for it. You’ll learn how to evaluate the success of your topic before investing time and energy much into producing the content. </p><p>You’ll also learn how to develop amazing content, without the need for expensive tools and software. You’ll get research and scripting techniques that will save you significant time while you’re creating content. </p> <strong><p>Part 2: Market your course</strong><br/>This section will take you into topics such as pricing your course, structuring a successful pre-launch and ultimately getting your course to people who need it most. The course will go into the details and include specific landing page templates, successful email copy and lists of people and companies who can help you bring your course to an even larger audience.</p><p>The course then dives into an exhaustive list of 20+ places all prioritized by impact, that can help instructors without any kind of audience create a successful launch. We show you how to get the best out of social media, online forums, daily deal websites, course directories, offline events, Kickstarter etc. Finally, John and Eliot share the strategies that have been vital in helping them reach their revenue goals which to date for 2014 includes over $2M in revenue.</p> <p>To round this section off, Ankur interviews 10+ other 'teacher entrepreneurs' each with their unique strengths. Some highlights from this section include:</p><p><ul><li>Learn how <b>Paul Solt</b> and <b>Justin Mitchel</b> used Kickstarter to presell 6 figures worth of online courses that had not been developed.</li><li>See how successful author <b>David Kadavy</b> converted a best-selling book into a best-selling online course.</li><li>Watch <b>Mattan Griffel</b> explain how created the #1 best selling course on Skillshare and then leveraged that into building a Y-Combinator backed company.</li><li><b>Noah Kagan</b> set an audacious goal to make $1m from a single online course. And then beat it comfortably. Learn how he did it.</li><li>30x500 co-creator, <b>Amy Hoy</b> has made $1.5m helping people create online courses. Even more impressively, her students have made over $3m following her advice.</li></ul></p><p>A total of <b>12+ experts</b> with <b>6+ hours</b> of content share their best strategies. Aside from the full-length videos, the course will include complete transcripts and summaries.</p>"
