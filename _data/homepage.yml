  title: "About the Course"
  first_paragraph: "<p>One of the biggest changes of our time, is the shift to online education.</p><p>Today, there is a growing number of individual “teacher entrepreneurs” organizing what they know on any topic you can imagine into making thousands or in some case over a hundred thousand dollars in income every month.</p><p>The benefits of teaching an online course are remarkable. Unlike any other form, structuring what you know in a course allows you to create a connection with your audience, whether that’s to build your own following or to promote your company.</p><p>How did this come to be? In recent years, all the parts you need to produce courses – the best practices, technology and open distribution channels – have all become available for anyone to use.</p><p><strong><span class='underline'>Million Dollar Instructor</span></strong> is the comprehensive set of video lessons that will take you behind the scenes and teach you everything you need to create and launch an online course – from the best in the industry.</p><p>Throughout, you’ll be led by John Nichols and Eliot Arntz, Founders of the independent online school Bitfountain.io. They’ll take you from their beginning to their incredible success – since April this year, John and Eliot have produced courses which have generated over $1M in revenue:</p>"
